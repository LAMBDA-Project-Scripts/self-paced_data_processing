# Self-paced data processing scripts

This repository contains scripts for pre-processing the data obtained from the [Gorilla](gorilla.sc) data collection service.

## Running
To run the main script, all you need is the command

```
python3 preprocess_data.py
```

The script requires all the source CSV files to be placed inside the `data` directory. These files are not provided here.
